    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialization:** Choose an initial set of cluster centroids or representatives. The number of clusters (K) can be predefined by the user or determined using algorithms like the elbow method or silhouette analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Assignment Step:** Assign each data point to the nearest cluster centroid based on a similarity or distance metric. Common distance metrics include Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, or cosine similarity. Data points are assigned to the cluster with the centroid closest to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Update Step:** Recalculate the cluster centroids based on the data points assigned to each cluster in the previous step. The centroid of a cluster is typically the mean or median of the data points in that cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Convergence Check:** Check if the assignment of data points to clusters and the positions of the centroids have changed. If there is no significant change, the algorithm has converged, and clustering is complete. If not, repeat the assignment and update steps until convergence is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Cluster Evaluation:** Depending on the specific clustering algorithm and goals, you may need to evaluate the quality of the clusters formed. Common evaluation metrics include silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, or within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS).\n",
